# Convex-Hull-Graham
Convex Hull with [Graham's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan) is one of the optimal-est form to find the convex hull on two dimensions. 

I'm excited to share with you this program cause I tried hard until I achieved it.

Again, __this code is not bug-free__.

The language used in the implementation is [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

#### This and other programs are result of the subject "Computational Geometry" from the program of Physics of the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico)
